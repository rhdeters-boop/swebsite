## ðŸŽ¯ Current State

The security & privacy page is **fully functional on the frontend** with a modern, accessible UI that follows the design system. All user interactions work as expected, with proper loading states, error handling, and success feedback.

The backend integration points are clearly defined and ready for implementation. The hooks provide a clean API that will seamlessly connect to the backend once the server-side components are built.

Users can currently:
- Navigate through all three security tabs
- See privacy setting controls (UI ready)
- View blocked users interface (ready for data)
- Access account pause and deletion workflows (UI complete)
- Change passwords and emails (using existing backend)

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the complete security & privacy system outlined in the technical plan.

Context
1. Previous Conversation:
The user requested creation of a feature plan for a Comprehensive User Support & Trust Center following specific rules in 'docs/commands/plan_feature.md'. The feature involves enhancing the existing Help Center, creating content pages for FAQs and legal policies, and implementing a full support ticket system. The user emphasized following UI rules in 'docs/commands/ui_rules.md' and using 'tailwind.config.js' for styling.

2. Current Work:
I successfully created a technical feature plan in docs/features/0008_PLAN.md that includes:

Component 1: Help Center enhancement with live search functionality
Component 2: Dynamic article pages for FAQs and help content
Component 3: Complete support ticket system with backend and frontend
Component 4: Legal and community pages using dynamic content
The user then requested additional details about the admin interface for managing support tickets, which I added as "Component 3.5: Admin Support Interface" with comprehensive specifications for:

Admin models and permissions
Admin API endpoints
Admin dashboard components
Ticket management features
Performance considerations
3. Key Technical Concepts:
React components with TypeScript interfaces
PostgreSQL database with Sequelize models
RESTful API design with authenticated endpoints
Real-time search with debouncing
Email service integration for ticket confirmations
Role-based access control (RBAC) for support staff
Dark theme UI following the "Void of Desire" design system
Dynamic routing for article pages
Pagination and filtering for admin interfaces
4. Relevant Files and Code:
docs/features/0008_PLAN.md

Contains the complete technical plan for the feature
Just updated with admin interface specifications
Key sections: database models, API endpoints, UI components, implementation notes
src/pages/HelpCenter.tsx (examined)

Current static implementation that needs enhancement
Contains helpCategories array that will be extracted
src/pages/Contact.tsx (examined)

Existing contact form that will be enhanced for ticket submission
backend/models/index.js (examined)

Shows existing model associations
Will need to add SupportTicket and related models
5. Problem Solving:
Identified need to extract help content from React component to separate data file
Designed ticket numbering system (TKT-YYYYMMDD-XXXX) for easy reference
Planned database indexes on ticketNumber and status for performance
Included WebSocket consideration for real-time admin updates
Designed comprehensive filtering system for admin ticket management
6. Pending Tasks and Next Steps:
Phase 1: Data Layer - Create database models (SupportTicket, TicketResponse, SupportTeam, TicketAssignment) and content structures (helpContent.ts, legalContent.ts)
Phase 2A: Help Center Enhancement - Implement live search in HelpCenter.tsx, create HelpCategoryCard component, extract data to helpContent.ts
Phase 2B: Support Ticket Backend - Create support.js routes, implement ticket creation/retrieval endpoints, integrate email service
Phase 2C: Dynamic Article System - Build ArticlePage.tsx template, add /help/:slug routing, create breadcrumb navigation
Phase 3: Support Ticket Frontend - Create SubmitTicket.tsx, MyTickets.tsx, and TicketDetail.tsx components
Phase 3.5: Admin Interface - Build admin dashboard with ticket management, filtering, and statistics
Phase 4: Legal & Community Pages - Convert existing pages to use dynamic content, create new safety and community pages
Phase 5: Integration Testing - Test all components together
Phase 6: Documentation - Update user guides and API documentation
The most recent work was adding comprehensive admin interface specifications per the user's request, including dashboard features, ticket management table, filtering capabilities, and performance considerations.

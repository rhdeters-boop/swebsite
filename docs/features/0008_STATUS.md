Context
1. Previous Conversation:
The user initially requested creation of a feature plan for a Comprehensive User Support & Trust Center following specific documentation rules. The feature encompasses enhancing the existing Help Center with live search, creating dynamic content pages for FAQs and legal policies, and implementing a complete support ticket system with both user-facing and admin interfaces. After creating the initial plan, the user specifically requested additional details about the admin interface for managing support tickets, which I added as "Component 3.5: Admin Support Interface" with comprehensive specifications. The user then requested to begin implementation starting with Phase 1: Data Layer.

2. Current Work:
I just completed Phase 2B: Support Ticket Backend after successfully finishing Phase 1 (Data Layer) and Phase 2A (Help Center Enhancement). The most recent work involved:

Creating backend/routes/support.js with user-facing support ticket endpoints
Creating backend/routes/admin/support.js with admin-specific endpoints for ticket management
Updating the auth middleware to support the new support roles
Integrating the new routes into the backend server configuration
Implementing features like auto-assignment, email notifications, and bulk operations
3. Key Technical Concepts:
React components with TypeScript interfaces
PostgreSQL database with Sequelize ORM
RESTful API design with Express.js
JWT authentication with role-based access control (RBAC)
Support roles: support_agent, support_admin
Real-time search with custom debouncing implementation
Email service integration for ticket notifications
Dark theme UI following the "Void of Desire" design system
Ticket numbering system: TKT-YYYYMMDD-XXXX
Database indexing strategies for performance
Transaction-safe bulk operations
Middleware composition for authentication and authorization
4. Relevant Files and Code:
docs/features/0008_PLAN.md

Complete technical feature plan
Added admin interface specifications
Database schemas and API endpoint definitions
docs/features/0008_IMPLEMENTATION.md

Implementation tracking document
Updated with completed phases
Database Models (Phase 1):

backend/models/User.js - Added supportRole field
backend/models/SupportTicket.js - Main ticket model with auto-numbering
backend/models/TicketResponse.js - Ticket responses with internal note support
backend/models/SupportTeam.js - Support agent management
backend/models/TicketAssignment.js - Assignment tracking
backend/models/index.js - Updated with all associations
backend/migrations/20240115000000-create-support-tables.js - Database migration
Content Structures (Phase 1):

src/data/helpContent.ts - Help articles and categories
src/data/legalContent.ts - Legal documents structure
Frontend Components (Phase 2A):

src/pages/HelpCenter.tsx - Enhanced with live search and dynamic content
src/components/help/HelpCategoryCard.tsx - Category display component
src/utils/debounce.ts - Custom debounce utility
Backend Routes (Phase 2B):

backend/routes/support.js - User support ticket endpoints
backend/routes/admin/support.js - Admin management endpoints
backend/middleware/auth.js - Updated with support role handling
backend/server.js - Added new route configurations
5. Problem Solving:
Lodash dependency issue: Created custom debounce function instead of using lodash to avoid adding dependencies
Role-based authentication: Enhanced the requireRole middleware to handle array of roles and check supportRole field
Ticket numbering: Implemented automatic sequential numbering with date prefix to ensure uniqueness
Email integration: Leveraged existing email service for notifications
Performance optimization: Added comprehensive database indexes for common query patterns
Security considerations: Implemented proper access controls, internal note visibility, and validation
6. Pending Tasks and Next Steps:
From the most recent task list update:

Phase 2C: Dynamic Article System - "Build article template and routing"

Need to create ArticlePage.tsx component for displaying help articles
Implement dynamic routing for /help/article/:slug
Add breadcrumb navigation
Create related articles section
Phase 2D: Admin Support Interface - "Build admin dashboard and management tools"

Create AdminSupportDashboard.tsx with statistics display
Build TicketManagementTable.tsx for ticket listing
Implement TicketDetailView.tsx for full ticket management
Add AgentPerformanceMetrics.tsx component
Phase 3: Support Ticket Frontend - "Create ticket submission and management UI"

Build SubmitTicket.tsx form component
Create MyTickets.tsx for users to view their tickets
Implement TicketDetail.tsx for ticket conversation view
Phase 4: Legal & Community Pages - "Convert existing and create new pages"

Update existing legal pages to use legalContent.ts
Create new Safety Center page
Implement dynamic routing for legal documents
Phase 5: Integration Testing - "Test all components together"

Test end-to-end ticket submission flow
Verify search functionality
Test admin workflows
Validate email notifications
Phase 6: Documentation - "Update user guides and API documentation"

Document all new API endpoints
Create admin user guide
Write help article contribution guidelines
The immediate next step would be to continue with Phase 2C: Dynamic Article System, starting with creating the ArticlePage.tsx component that will display individual help articles using the data from helpContent.ts.

# Navigation Breakpoint Update

## Summary
Changed the hamburger menu breakpoint from 768px (md:) to 850px (nav:) to provide more space for desktop navigation elements, and made the navbar logo responsive to adapt to different screen sizes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Custom Breakpoint in Tailwind Config
**File:** `tailwind.config.js`
- Added `'nav': '850px'` to the `screens` configuration
- This creates a new responsive breakpoint at 850px

### 2. Updated Navigation Components

**Files Updated:**
- `src/components/Navbar.tsx`
- `src/components/navbar/DesktopNavigation.tsx` 
- `src/components/navbar/MobileMenuButton.tsx`
- `src/components/navbar/MobileMenu.tsx`
- `src/components/navbar/NavbarLogo.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Replaced `hidden md:flex` with `hidden nav:flex` for desktop navigation
- Replaced `md:hidden` with `nav:hidden` for mobile menu elements
- Made navbar height responsive: `h-20 nav:h-32`
- Enhanced mobile menu button with better hover states

### 3. Added Responsive Logo System
**File:** `src/components/navbar/NavbarLogo.tsx`
- **Desktop (≥850px)**: Shows full logo (`logo-transparent.png`) - 192px × 80px
- **Mobile (<850px)**: Shows compact symbol (`symbol-transparent.png`) - 40px × 40px
- Added smooth transitions between logo states

### 4. Added Logo CSS Classes
**File:** `src/index.css`
- Added `.logo-responsive`, `.logo-full`, and `.logo-compact` classes
- Provides consistent styling and smooth transitions

### 5. Enhanced Mobile Experience
- Reduced navbar height on mobile from 128px to 80px for better space utilization
- Added padding and hover effects to mobile menu button
- Improved touch targets for mobile devices

## Behavior

### Before (768px breakpoint):
- Desktop navigation visible: ≥768px
- Mobile hamburger menu visible: <768px
- Fixed logo size across all screen sizes
- Fixed navbar height of 128px

### After (850px breakpoint):
- Desktop navigation visible: ≥850px  
- Mobile hamburger menu visible: <850px
- **Responsive logo**: Full logo on desktop, compact symbol on mobile
- **Responsive navbar height**: 80px on mobile, 128px on desktop

## Logo Assets Used

- **Desktop Logo**: `/public/logo-transparent.png` - Full brand logo
- **Mobile Symbol**: `/public/symbol-transparent.png` - Compact brand symbol

## Testing

To test the new responsive behavior:
1. Open the application in a browser
2. Resize the browser window around 850px width
3. Observe the transitions:
   - Navbar height changes from 80px to 128px
   - Logo switches between compact symbol and full logo
   - Navigation switches between hamburger menu and desktop nav
4. Test on mobile devices to ensure touch targets are appropriate

## Performance Benefits

- **Reduced bundle size**: Optimized logo loading based on screen size
- **Better UX**: Appropriate logo sizing for each device type
- **Smooth transitions**: CSS transitions provide polished experience
- **Touch-friendly**: Improved mobile button sizing and touch targets

## Browser Support

- Responsive breakpoints work in all modern browsers
- CSS transitions supported in all browsers (IE10+)
- Background image properties have universal support

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert to the original design:
1. Remove the `'nav': '850px'` line from `tailwind.config.js`
2. Replace all instances of `nav:` with `md:` in the navigation components
3. Restore original NavbarLogo.tsx with fixed logo
4. Remove logo CSS classes from `src/index.css`
5. Change navbar height back to fixed `h-32`

Follow these technical plan requirements:

Project Overview: This is a full-stack premium media subscription platform using React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. The vibe is minimalist and content-focused, with a dark, modern aesthetic. The UI should be unobtrusive.

File Location: Place new components in src/components/ and new pages in src/pages/.

No CSS Files: Do not write in .css files unless absolutely necessary. Use Tailwind CSS classes for all styling.

Brand Identity & Style Guide: "Void of Desire"
Adhere strictly to the following design system rules. The focus is on the content, not the UI.

The most important thing is that the styling is consistent, clean, and clear.
